    This Privacy Policy describes privacy rights regarding the collection, usage, storage, sharing and protection of personal information. It is in line with applicable regulations including database applications, services, tools and physical contact with us regardless of how you access or use them. If you have created a username, identification code, password or any other piece of information as part of the access security measures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any third party. We reserve the right to disable any user identification code or password, whether chosen by you or assigned by us, at any time if we believe you have failed to comply with any of these terms and conditions.</p>
    <p><strong>2.2 Consent</strong><br>
    The acceptance will give consent upon access to the platforms, or use of services, content, features, technologies or functions offered on our website, digital platforms or visit any of our offices for official or non-official purposes. This Policy governs the use of our services and intervention projects by our users and stakeholders unless otherwise agreed through a written contract.</p>
    <p><strong>2.3 Your Personal Information</strong><br>
    When you use our Services, we collect information sent to us by your computer, mobile phone or other electronic access device. The automatically collected information includes but not limited to data about the pages you access, computer IP address, device ID or unique identifier, device type, geo-location information, computer and connection information, mobile network information, statistics on page views, trace to and from the sites, referral URL, ad data, standard web log data, still and moving images. We may collect the information you provide to us, including but not limited to details submitted through web forms, survey responses, account updates, emails, phone numbers, the organization you represent, your social position, and any correspondence with support services. Additionally, we may gather information related to your transactions, enquiries, and activities on our platform or premises. We may also use information obtained from third parties, such as social media platforms.</p>
    <p><strong>2.4 What we will do with your personal information</strong><br>
    The purpose of collecting your personal information is to give you efficient, enjoyable and secure services. We may use your information to:<br>
    1. Provide service and support<br>
    2. Process applications and send notice about your transaction to request parties<br>
    3. Verify your identity<br>
    4. Resolve disputes / collect fees and troubleshoot problems<br>

    <p><strong>2.5 Cookies</strong><br>
    Cookies are small files placed on your computer’s hard drive that enables the website to identify your computer as you view different pages. Cookies allow websites and applications to store your preferences in order to present contents, options or functions that are specific to you. Like most interactive websites, our website uses cookies to enable the tracking of your activity for the duration of a session. Our website uses only encrypted session cookies which are erased either after a predefined timeout period or once the user logs out of the platform and closes the browser. Session cookies do not collect information from the user’s computer. They will typically store information in the form of a session identification that does not personally identify the user.</p>
    <p><strong>2.6 How we protect your personal information</strong><br>
    We store and process your personal information on our computers. We will seek consent where we need to send your data to a country without an adequate data protection law. We protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls.</p>
    <p><strong>2.7 Security</strong><br>
    We will always hold your information securely. To prevent unauthorized access to your information, we have implemented strong controls and security safeguards at the technical and operational levels. This site uses Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) to ensure secure transmission of your personal data. You should see the padlock symbol in your URL address bar once you are successfully logged into the platform. The URL address will also start with https:// depicting a secure webpage. SSL applies encryption between two points such as your PC and the connecting server. Any data transmitted during the session will be encrypted before transmission and decrypted at the receiving end. This is to ensure that data cannot be read during transmission. We have also taken measures to comply with global Information Security Management Systems (ISMS); we therefore have put in place digital and physical security measures to limit or eliminate possibilities of data privacy breach incidents.</p>
    <p><strong>2.8 Data Confidentiality Rights</strong><br>
    Your information is regarded as confidential and will not be divulged to any third party except under legal and/or regulatory conditions. You have the right to request sight of, and copies of any and all information we keep on you, if such requests are made in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act and other relevant enactments. While we are responsible for safeguarding the information entrusted to us, your role in fulfilling confidentiality duties includes, but is not limited to, adopting and enforcing appropriate security measures such as non-sharing of passwords and other platform logins details and adherence with physical security protocols on the premises, dealing with only authorised officers of the agency.</p>
    <p><strong>2.9 Links to other website and premises</strong><br>
    Certain transaction processing channels may require links to other websites or organisations other than ours. Please note that we are not responsible and have no control over the website domain. We do not monitor or review the content of other websites which are linked from ours. Please be aware that we are responsible for the privacy practices or content of our websites. We encourage users to be aware that when they visit the website, they should evaluate the security and trustworthiness of the site before providing any personal information. We will not accept any responsibility for loss or damage resulting from the disclosure of personal information to third parties.</p>
    <p><strong>2.10 Governing Law</strong><br>
    This Privacy Policy is made pursuant to the applicable Data Protection Regulation and other relevant laws, regulations or international conventions. Where any provision of this Policy is deemed inconsistent with a law, regulation or convention, such provision shall be subject to the overriding law, regulation or convention.</p>
    <h4>3. Breaches of Policy</h4>
    <p>We will take all necessary measures to remedy any breach of this policy including the use of our disciplinary or contractual processes where appropriate.</p>
